Launched the ProtonVPN client and logged in with the account credentials.

Connect to a VPN Server:
Opened the ProtonVPN client and viewed the list of available servers (limited to specific countries in the free tier, e.g., United States, Netherlands, Japan).
Selected a server in the United States for minimal latency (based on proximity).
Clicked the “Connect” button, and the client established a connection within 5–10 seconds.
Confirmed the connection via the client’s interface, which displayed “Connected” and the server’s location (see vpn_connection_screenshot.png).

Verify IP Address Change:
Without VPN: Opened Google Chrome and visited whatismyipaddress.com to record the original public IP address (e.g., 192.168.X.X, location: local city).
With VPN: After connecting to the US server, revisited whatismyipaddress.com. The IP address changed to one associated with the VPN server (e.g., a US-based IP, location: United States).
Observation: The IP address change confirmed that the VPN successfully masked the original IP.

Confirm Encrypted Traffic:
Navigated to example.com using Google Chrome while connected to the VPN.
Verified the HTTPS protocol in the browser’s address bar (padlock icon indicating secure connection).
Inspected ProtonVPN client logs (accessible via the client’s interface) to confirm that traffic was routed through an encrypted tunnel using OpenVPN protocol and AES-256 encryption.
Used Chrome’s Developer Tools (Network tab) to verify that no unencrypted HTTP requests were made.
Observation: All traffic was encrypted, ensuring secure communication.

Compare Browsing Speed and IP:
Speed Test with VPN:
Conducted a speed test using speedtest.net while connected to the US server.
Recorded: Download speed ~45 Mbps, Upload speed ~10 Mbps, Ping ~50 ms.
Speed Test without VPN:
Disconnected the VPN via the ProtonVPN client and confirmed the original IP address was restored on [whatism
Ran another speed test: Download speed ~60 Mbps, Upload speed ~15 Mbps, Ping ~20 ms.

IP Verification:
After disconnecting, revisited whatismyipaddress.com to confirm the original IP address was displayed.

Observation:
The VPN reduced download and upload speeds by approximately 25% due to encryption overhead and server distance.
Latency (ping) increased due to routing through the VPN server.
The original IP address was restored upon disconnection, confirming proper VPN functionality.

Research VPN Encryption and Privacy Features:
Encryption: ProtonVPN uses AES-256 encryption, a military-grade standard that ensures data confidentiality by scrambling it into an unreadable format without the decryption key.
Tunneling Protocols:
OpenVPN: A secure, open-source protocol used by ProtonVPN, supporting UDP and TCP for reliability and speed.
WireGuard: A modern, lightweight protocol available in ProtonVPN, offering faster performance with strong security.

Privacy Features:
No-Logs Policy: ProtonVPN claims not to log user activity, enhancing privacy (verified via their privacy policy).
Kill Switch: Prevents data leaks by blocking unsecured connections if the VPN disconnects unexpectedly.
DNS Leak Protection: Ensures DNS requests are routed through the VPN, preventing exposure of browsing activity.
